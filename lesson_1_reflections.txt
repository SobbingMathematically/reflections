How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Obviously the bug was in one of the lines that was changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can always return to working code if you try something that requires changing a lot.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

This was explicitly explained in the videos, why make me repeat it?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

One is for programming and one is for office docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gets you the different commits, git diff let's you compare.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Can always revert completely.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

programming and logging progress
