When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with other people, or not always using the same machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If there are other people working on it you don't know what will be added.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branch is a part of a repository, fork lets you copy a repository you can't edit, and clone let's you copy things internally

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
so you know where the local stands relative to the remote, and can work without internet access

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
google drive, not having the ability to rollback and branch would be the biggests problems
